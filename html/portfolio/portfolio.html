                    The image to the left will lead you to another page that
                    contains previous projects I have done. Most of them
                    showcase my highschool projects working with javascript.

                    The button will send you to a page of templates I have
                    created. So far I have recreated a Korean restaurant.

                    This page will contain Photos I have taken over the years
                    for both class and personal. It is divided up into animals
                    nature, and buildings. I will be adding a portrait gallery
                    as well.
