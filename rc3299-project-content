# Reuben Clemens’ Portfolio

## Home
### Description:
The main purpose of the Home page is to act as a hub for the other pages. To add substance, I plan to add a brief introduction of myself and the content my online portfolio holds. I will also implement the skills I learn over the course to make the page look aesthetically nice and user friendly to attract clients.

### Content:
Hello, My name is Reuben Clemens and I am currently a student at Drexel University studying UX UI design. 

The Portfolio I have contains previous projects I have made as well as templates I have created. These templates follow general designs to show what type of styles I am able to replicate for your website.
I also provided pictures in ‘Photography’ that may give insight in my ability of framing and also my capability in taking shots for the website itself.

The About Me provides more information on previous experiences and other skills I am able to deliver. It also contains links to my github and other such sites.

If you wish to contact me, the Contact page contains my email, phone number, and zoom. 


## Portfolio
### High School & Side Projects
### Description:
This page is a gallery of previous projects I have worked on. I will set up videos along with descriptors of how they work or the skills used to develop them.

### Content:

- #### Matching-Game:
The matching game works through the use of div tags and onclick events. Each div has a unique number id that gets sent through the clickevent() function. The id then gets assigned a certain card and will keep that value throughout the game. When the user clicks on that card/div it will show the value, and when a second card is clicked with the same value, it will change the img source to a picture that represents it's been matched. If it wasn't a match, it will just reset to the back of a card. The score is just an increment of whenever a match does happen.

## Templates
### Description:
I want to create at least 3 different pages representing general businesses that rely on websites (Shopping, Restaurants, Organization).

### Content:

Shopping: This template will provide you with a search system, categorization of items you may have, and pages for describing your business and ways to contact you.

Restaurants: This template provides a menu system along with ways to schedule a reservation or catering services. There is also the standard contact and about us page.

Organization: (I was thinking of a charity or non-profit website, but I need to research the specific pages that are common for them)


## Photography
### Description:
This web page will contain a gallery of photos I have taken and will give the user the ability to swipe through them. I will also try to categorize the types of photos(portrait, animals, environment). I know that this is a class for UX UI, but I hope to make it a portfolio for all skills at my disposal.

### Content:

These are photos I have taken over the years. So far I have focused on pictures of animals and environments, but I plan to develop my skills and portfolio further with my photo class. Categories such as portraits will be added overtime.


## About Me
### Content:
My name is Reuben Clemens and I am a Sophomore in the FYE(First Year Exploratory) program. My previous year was spent exploring the CS field and learning the concepts for coding. While I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it, I found that my stimulation lied somewhere else. After making contact with my Advisor, I found the UX UI major and how it incorporated the coding aspect I enjoyed. I am now learning design and creating user-friendly websites. (Will go more in depth as I learn more UX UI)
