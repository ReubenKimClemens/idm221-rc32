                My name is Reuben Clemens and I am a Sophomore in the 
                FYE(First Year Exploratory) program. My previous year 
                was spent exploring the CS field and learning the concepts 
                for coding. While I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it, 
                I found that my stimulation lied somewhere else. After making 
                contact with my Advisor, I found the UX UI major and how it 
                incorporated the coding aspect I enjoyed. I am now learning 
                design and creating user-friendly websites.
