            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, My name is Reuben Clemens and I am currently a student 
                at Drexel University studying UX UI design.
            </p>

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                The Portfolio I have contains previous projects I have made 
                as well as templates I have created. These templates follow 
                general designs to show what type of styles I am able to 
                replicate for your website. I also provided pictures in 
                Photography that may give insight in my ability of framing
                and also my capability in taking shots for the website itself.
            </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                The About Me provides more information on previous experiences
                 and other skills I am able to deliver. It also contains links
                 to my github and other such sites.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>
                If you wish to contact me, the Contact page contains my 
                email, phone number, and zoom. 
            </p>
