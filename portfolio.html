                    The video playing above is a previous javascript project
                    I worked on during highschool. It works by keeping a list
                    of each players move and comparing it to an array of objects
                    that contain information on winning patterns.

                    The image above shows the website I redesigned for my idm211
                    class.The original website had many problems with readability
                    and contained too much excess space. I removed some and made
                    the design simplier.

                    I recently took phto110 at drexel university where I learned more
                    about positive and negative space, scale, and geometric concepts.
